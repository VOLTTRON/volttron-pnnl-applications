            #           production costs, in this case) and dual costs (which are modified using gross profit or
            #           consumer cost) to estimate the magnitude of power imbalance in each active time interval. Under
            #           certain conditions, a solution is guaranteed. Many iterations may be needed. The method can be
            #           fooled, so I've found, by interim oscillatory solutions. This method may fail when large assets
            #           have linear, not quadratic, cost functions.

            # Method 2: Interpolation - If certain requirements are met, the solution might be greatly accelerated by
            #           interpolating between the inflection points of the net power curve.
            #           Requirements:
            #           1. All Neighbors and LocalAssets are represented by linear or quadratic cost functions, thus
            #              ensuring that the net power curve is perfectly linear between its inflection points.
            #           2: All Neighbors and Assets update their active vertices in a way that represents their
            #              residual flexibility, which can be none, thus ensuring a meaningful connection between
            #              balancing in time intervals and scheduling of the individual Neighbors and LocalAssets.
