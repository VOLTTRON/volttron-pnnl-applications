        #            (1) all the summed vertices in a viable range are turned into transactive records,

        #                Tests were necessarily changed to achieve consistency.

        #                ones. The minimum and maximum powers will now be limited to either the hard constraint or the

        #            general principle is that all sent, prepared, and received transactive signals should remain always
        #            in the perspective of the remote neighbor.
        #            - Losses of local power due to inefficient importation should be re-added for the perspective of
        #              the remote neighbor as power is IMPORTED from the remote neighbor.
        #            - Increased marginal price of imported power from this remote neighbor should be restored again
        #              to lower prices at the remote neighbor. This refers now to energy that is IMPORTED from the
        #              remote neighbor.
        #            - Demand charges added to peak power supply must be removed from peak power to be imported from
        #              the remote neighbor.
        #            A general principle should be that an equilibrium point is unchanged by the importation and
        #            exportation of signals until an actual perturbation occurs. The steps are, in each time interval,
        #            (1) Use method 'sum_vertices()' to find the supplementary response vertices for the neighbor.
        #            (2) Act on the vertices to REMOVE impacts of demand charges and marginal losses in this copy.

        # This method corrects supply from neighbors based on transport inefficiency and the impact of transport losses
        # the effective marginal price. While all transactive signals should be stated from the perspective of the
        # remote neighbor, the active vertices should reflect the following modifications:
        # (1) Supply power is reduced to remove transport energy losses.
        # (2) Marginal price in increased to include the impact of marginal losses.
        # INPUTS:
        # - vertices: A list of vertex struct objects. Typically, these would be a set of raw vertex objects that have
        #             been derived from received transactive records. The remote neighbor supplies these records from
        #             its own perspective at the border of its circuit, excluding transport. This method will modify and
        #             return updated vertices. NOTE: the set of vertices should be for precisely one time interval.
        # - threshold: Power demand threshold this time interval.88
        #
        # USES:
        # - self.maximumPower:
        # - self.lossFactor
        #
        # OUTPUTS:
        # - corrected_vertices: Vertex objects as corrected by this method to have reduced supply power and increased
        #                       marginal price. The caller is responsible to store these values as active vertices.

        # 200702DJH: I had originally included the implications of transport losses within the base neighbor class
        #            methods. I'm finding that a more modular approach may be useful if the template methods are to
        #            facilitate diverse market rules and procedures. Therefore, I am introducing methods to include and
        #            later remove implications of losses and demand charges. These effects do not exist upstream of the
        #            local transactive node agent, but they must be accounted in the local prices. I'm concluding that
        #            the effects should be removed for the upstream neighbor's perspective. Furthermore, the three local
        #            transactive signal representations ("my," "received," and "sent" signals) should always be stated
        #            in respect to the neighbor's, not the local agent's, perspective. These modular methods should be
        #            invoked to correct this neighbor model's active vertices, which should be stated in respect to the
        #            local transactive node and agent.
        #            The method is being defined as a function to help make sure it is not applied multiple times.
        #            This revision corrects some errors implemented in prior versions. The impact on LMP is now properly
        #            formulated from marginal losses.
        #            The price and power corrections are based on a careful review of this impacts in a white paper
        #            "Addressing the Marginal Value of Transport Losses."
