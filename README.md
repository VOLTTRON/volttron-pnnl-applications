The repository contains applications that revolve around (and not limited to) following use cases:

- **Energy Efficiency** - The applications that help control building energy system performance. These applications perform RCx diagnostics on 
air-handling units (AHUs) and economizer systems to detect operational problems that when corrected lead to energy 
savings and improved occupant comfort

- **Grid Services** - Building-Grid Integration to support “beyond demand response” approach and integration of distributed energy resources” to grid. 
The applications include Intelligent Load Control (ILC) and Transactive ILC applications and set of market agents to 
demonstrate Transactive Network Template (TNT) framework that allows DERs to participate in utility price market and decide on "optimal" price.
